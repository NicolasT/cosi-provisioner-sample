# cosi-provisioner-sample
A sample provisioner for [COSI](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-spec), the Container Object Storage Interface. This can be used as a reference to implement a COSI provisioner for 'real' storage systems.

This project will be migrated into the [kubernetes-sigs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/) organization once a repository has been created.
